              <p>The 'Hotel Blue Orchid' website was conceived as a complete web application, designed following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. For the backend logic, Java was implemented using the Spring Boot framework. On the frontend, HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework were combined to provide an attractive and responsive user interface, ensuring an optimal experience across various devices. Data persistence was achieved through the use of SQL in MySQL Workbench, configuring a relational database to store relevant hotel and customer information</p>

            <p>Developed as a final project for the Data Structures and Algorithms course, 'KO VideoGame Tournament' is a video game tournament simulation that leverages the power of data structures and algorithms. Specifically, linked lists were used for participant management, binary trees for organizing elimination rounds, and sorting algorithms for ranking players based on their performance. This project demonstrates the practical application of theoretical concepts in a competitive event simulation context </p>

            <p>This website, which serves as my personal portfolio, was initially built using HTML and CSS to present an overview of my skills and projects. Although currently limited to these technologies, it reflects my commitment to continuous learning and improvement. Recognizing the importance of interactivity and dynamic functionality, I plan to expand this website by incorporating more advanced technologies. The goal is to transform this portfolio into a complete web application that not only showcases my work but also demonstrates my ability to adapt and master new technologies in web development.</p>
