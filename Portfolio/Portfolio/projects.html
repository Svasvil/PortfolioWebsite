         What better way to show how I and my teams have worked on different projects than showing them to you, so you can

         <p>
          The 'Hotel Blue Orchid' website was conceived as a complete web application, designed following the
          Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. For the backend logic, Java was implemented using the Spring
          Boot framework. On the frontend, HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework were combined to provide an attractive
          and responsive user interface, ensuring an optimal experience across various devices. Data persistence was achieved
          through the use of SQL in MySQL Workbench, configuring a relational database to store relevant hotel and customer
          information.

          Developed as a final project for the Data Structures and Algorithms course, 'KO VideoGame Tournament' is a video
          game tournament simulation that leverages the power of data structures and algorithms. Specifically, linked lists
          were used for participant management, binary trees for organizing elimination rounds, and sorting algorithms for
          ranking players based on their performance. This project demonstrates the practical application of theoretical
          concepts in a competitive event simulation context.

          This website, which serves as my personal portfolio, was initially built using HTML and CSS to present an overview
          of my skills and projects. Although currently limited to these technologies, it reflects my commitment to
          continuous learning and improvement. Recognizing the importance of interactivity and dynamic functionality, I plan
          to expand this website by incorporating more advanced technologies. The goal is to transform this portfolio into a
          complete web application that not only showcases my work but also demonstrates my ability to adapt and master new
          technologies in web development.
